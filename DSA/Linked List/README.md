# Linked List

- A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are stored in sequrnce but not neccessarily in contiguous memory locations.
- Each node consists of:
  - **Data:** The value or data the node holds
  - **Pointer (next):** A reference or pointer to the nexxt node in the sequences.

- Linked lists are dynamic in size.
- which makes them ideal for situations where the size of the data is unpredictable or changes frequently.

### Types of Linked Lists:

#### Singly Linked List

Each node points to the next node and the last node points to NULL.

#### Doubly Linked List

Each node has two pointers, one poinying to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.

#### Cirular Linked List

The last node point back to the first node, forming a circle.

### Basic Operations on Linked List

  - **Insertion:** Adding a new node.
  - **Deletion:** Removing an existing node.
  - **Traversal:** Visiting each node to access or prints its data.
  - **Search:** Finding a specific node.
